# Examples

This page collects some (hopefully educational) examples I like using in courses. All material is released under MIT license and I'm always looking for feedback suggestions. 

1. `exLaplaceWithSD.ipynb` - solves Laplace's equation with Steepest Descent with exact line search. This example shows that the convergence of SD depends on the condition number of the Hessian (which in this case becomes more ill-conditioned as the discretization becomes more accurate).
1. 'BacktrackedLinesearch.ipynb' - visualizes the concept behind backtracked line search and the Armijo condition.
